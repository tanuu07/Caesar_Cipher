Caesar Cipher Encryption Script
Description:

This Python script implements a basic Caesar cipher encryption algorithm. A Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. This script allows users to encrypt a given string using a specified key.
How to Use:

    Input: Run the script and enter the string you want to encrypt when prompted.
    Key: Enter an integer key that represents the number of positions each letter in the string should be shifted for encryption.
    Output: The script will output the encrypted string.

Example:

    Input: "Hello, World!"
    Key: 3
    Output: "Khoor, Zruog!"

Feel free to experiment with different input strings and keys to see how the encryption changes.
